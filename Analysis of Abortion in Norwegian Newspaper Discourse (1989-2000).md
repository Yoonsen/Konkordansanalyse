## Temporal Distribution (continued)

Notable peaks occurred in 1989, 1994, and 1995, suggesting periods of intensified public debate around abortion. The peak in 1989 likely reflects debates around abortion policy after the full implementation of the 1978 law on self-determined abortion had been in effect for a decade, while the 1994-1995 period may correspond to renewed political and ethical debates.

## Key Phrases and Terminology

The most common phrases in the discourse include:

- "Fri abort" (free abortion): 26 occurrences  
- "Selvbestemt abort" (self-determined abortion): 23 occurrences  
- "Provosert abort" (induced abortion): 3 occurrences  
- "Abortlov" (abortion law): 3 occurrences  
- "Illegal abort" (illegal abortion): 2 occurrences  
- "Rett til abort" (right to abortion): 2 occurrences

This terminology reflects the Norwegian legal framework where abortion is legally described as "selvbestemt" (self-determined) up to 12 weeks of pregnancy, a term that appears more frequently than the colloquial "fri abort" (free abortion).

- Various bishops, particularly in contexts of religious opposition

## Conclusion

The analysis of abortion discourse in Norwegian newspapers from 1989-2000 reveals a multifaceted public debate that encompassed political, ethical, religious, and rights-based dimensions. The discourse was primarily framed in terms of political debate and women's rights, with substantial inputs from religious and ethical perspectives.

The period shows a continuation of debates following the implementation of Norway's 1978 law on self-determined abortion, with recurring peaks in coverage suggesting moments when abortion returned to the forefront of public discourse. International comparisons, particularly with countries having more restrictive policies, served as important contextual references.

While political framing dominated the discourse, the significant presence of women's rights language indicates the establishment of abortion as a question of individual autonomy and choice in Norwegian society during this period, though continually contested by religious and ethical counterarguments.
